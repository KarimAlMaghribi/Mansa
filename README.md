# XRisk Frontend

## General 
This is the frontend for the XRisk project. It is built using React and Typescript.

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and provide your Firebase credentials there. The application reads these variables via `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_*` keys.

Ensure that the `.env` file is **not** committed to version control. The included `.gitignore` already excludes it for safety.
